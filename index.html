I was told that anyone who wishes to go into math should have a '90s HTML       looking website. Hopefully this lives up to those (low) standards. Also, the    long hair is not just a phase, it's who I am.

Hello! I am Varun Manmohan Gudibanda. I have graduated. I did mathematics. I got my BS and MS through the Math Honors Program. I did research with Professor Jason Howell in 2018 with a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship. I did research with Professor Franziska Weber in 2019/2020 which turned into my Master's Thesis.

If you want to quick overview of my academics, you can see a list of course I have taken <a href = "courses.html">here</a>
<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately I have some hobbies. I like solving Rubik's Cubes and have even gone to a few competitions. I also really like car racing and watch Formula 1. I also like to learn about the intricate and rich history of automobies - especially racing.
