I was told that anyone who wishes to go into math should have a '90s HTML       looking website. Hopefully this lives up to those (low) standards. Also, the    long hair is not just a phase, it's who I am.

<br/>
Hello! I am Varun Manmohan Gudibanda. I am currently a 3rd year grad student in mathematics at University of Wisconsin - Madison (Applied and Computational Math). My advisor is <a href = "https://people.math.wisc.edu/~lsmith/">Professor Leslie Smith</a> and I am currently working on heat convection. 
<br/>
<br/>
I did my undergraduate studies at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) where I got my BS and MS in mathematics through the Math Honors Program. While I was there, I did research with Professor Jason Howell in 2018 with a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship. I did research with Professor Franziska Weber in 2019 and 2020 which turned into my Master's Thesis. For more information about my research, check out my <a href = "research.html">research page</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to quick overview of my academics, you can see a list of course I have taken <a href = "courses.html">here</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately I have some hobbies. I like solving Rubik's Cubes and have even gone to a few competitions. I also really like car racing and watch Formula 1. I also like to learn about the intricate and rich history of automobies - especially racing.
