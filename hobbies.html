<h2>Rubik's Cubes</h2>
One of my biggest hobbies is speedcubing. I first learned how to solve a Rubik's Cube in 7th grade and have been speedcubing since 8th grade. I went to my first competition in my senior year of high school. You can check out my official results on my <a href = "https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016GUDI01">WCA Profile</a>. My fastest solve on 3x3 is 6.330 seconds and best average of 5 is 9.281 seconds. I can also solve it blindfolded (3BLD) and at some point was ranked 161 in the United States for it with a pretty slow time of 2 minutes and 40.42 seconds.

My brother first taught me how to solve a Rubik's Cube in the winter break of 7th grade. It was fun. Then in 8th grade I decided I wanted to speedcube. It got very fun. I can now solve a range of puzzles but solving for speed is my main forte. I went to my first competition my senior year of high school and since then have attended a few others. You can check out my official competition results on my <a href = "https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016GUDI01">WCA Profile</a>. Here is me at my very first competition looking like an idiot in this cardboard cube:

After my first competition, I had a huge surge of motivation and decided to sign up for the 2016 Nationals in Portland, Oregon. In the process of practicing for the competition,  I broke my best time at 3x3 (the "normal" cube) multiple times until it settled at a best time of 6.96 seconds, which is my fastest solve to date.

At the actual nationals competition, I achieved most of the results I had set out to get. My ultimate goal was to set a time in the 3x3 Blindfolded competition that would set me at top 100 in the nation. Unfortunately, due the nerves, I was unable to achieve that result but instead got me a solve that put me at 176 in the nation at the time:

In the month leading up to the competition, I decided to learn how to solve multiple cubes blindfolded for the MBLD (multiple blindfolded) category. At home I was able to solve 3 cubes blindfolded and decided to challange myself to repeat the result in competition. Despite two attempts to do so, I was only able to get 2 out of 3 at the competition. Nevertheless, I was quite happy:

Since then, I have been unable to give blindsolving as much attention as I have wanted. My goal is to regularly solve a cube blindfolded in less than a minute and to also one day solve 10 cubes blindfolded all at once for MBLD.

<h2> Car Racing </h2>
<p>
I have never raced a car. I just watch them race. There's not much to say here except that I watch the cars race on TV in Formula 1. I also loosely follow WEC (World Endurance Championship) and IndyCar. In Formula 1 I heavily support Ferrari. In the summer of 2018, I was in England and was fortunate enough to make a quick stop at the Donnington Collection of Grand Prix Cars. It was my first time ever seeing a Formula 1 Car. Here is me with Ayrton Senna's 1990 World Driver's Championship Winning McLaren MP4/5b:

</p>

I also got to see an actual IndyCar race in 2021. The cars went by so fast that it made me think "wow these cars are fast." It is truly mindblowing to see cars just inches from each other blast by at 150 mph.

<h2> Astrophotography </h2>
I have been into astronomy for a very long time. During the pandemic I got into astrophotography - taking pictures of space. I mostly took pictures from my backyard back home, but I also took some from other places as well. Here's a few:

North America Nebula in constellation Cygnus. Taken on July 4th so it was somewhat of a topical object. It's very pretty though I love the red.
